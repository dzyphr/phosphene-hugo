## About the project:

Chain Fission is a multi-faceted project focused on cross-chain atomic swaps.

An Atomic Swap is a cryptographic multi-party protocol that enforces a trustless hand-off of pre-generated secrets.

These secrets control the spending path of some coins on a blockchain that each party in the protocol wishes to aquire.

Thus Atomic Swaps allow for two parties to trustlessly "swap" coins using this mechanism.

A basic Atomic Swap protocol was initially discussed by Tier Nolan on the Bitcoin talk forums back in 2013: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=193281.msg2224949#msg2224949
