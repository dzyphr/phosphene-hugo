      <description>About the project: Atomic Analogs is a multi-faceted project focused on cross-chain atomic swaps.
Atomic Swap is a cryptographic multi-party protocol that enforces a trustless hand-off of pre-generated secrets.
These secrets control the spending path of some coins on a blockchain that each party in the protocol wishes to aquire.
Thus Atomic Swaps allow for two parties to trustlessly &amp;ldquo;swap&amp;rdquo; coins using this mechanism.
A basic Atomic Swap protocol was initially discussed by Tier Nolan on the Bitcoin talk forums back in 2013: https://bitcointalk.</description>

Server Replication Notes
When testing rapid fire projectiles replicated on a multiplayer server, we discovered that high speed settings like 50,000 would cause errors on client replication. The errors would make it so the projectile impacts would not replicate at a specific proximity to the character even though the hit detection was still validating that the projectile was being handled.</description>

      <description>Outdated Tutorial, for Archival purposes mainly Page Dedicated to Vulkan API Here is my guide on booting from a fresh Ubuntu install to a VulkanSDK enabled setup so you can work with the vulkan-tutorial:
This is a rough guide I made while following Vulkan-Tutorial.com, it can be followed using any vulkan compatible Ubuntu Distro but its called 20.04 because thats the version I started on.
This guide will fill in details that I had to discover myself through research and looking through the comments on the tutorial.</description>
